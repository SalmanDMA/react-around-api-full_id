- a link to repository with the complete React application which uses this API;
- a link to the website that hosts your API.

## API Hosting

The API is hosted on the following domains:

- Production API: [api.around.mooo.com](https://api.around.mooo.com)
- Website: [around.mooo.com](https://around.mooo.com)

## Troubleshooting

### API Not Working

If the production API is not working, you can run the API server locally on your machine by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone `https://github.com/SalmanDMA/web_project_api_full.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd your-api-repo
3. Install the required dependencies:
   npm install
4. Start the API server:
   npm start
   This will start the API server on `http://localhost:3000`.
5. You can now make API requests to `http://localhost:3000` as if it were the production API.
   Please ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before running the API locally.
